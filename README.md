# ENG437 Communication Systems
This unit covers linear systems and lossless transmission, linear and exponential modulation techniques. Baseband pulse transmission, digital modulations. Digital transmission systems through noisy channels, error-correcting and detecting codes, network architecture and protocols applied in wireline and wireless transmission systems.

This unit is reliant on on-line materials. Students must have reliable access to the internet. Access to high-speed broadband is highly recommended.


## Unit Learning Outcomes
On completion of this unit a student should be able to:
1. Discuss the key issues in modern digital communication systems
2. Critically analyse the communication systems in the time and frequency domain
3. Describe network protocols and their application in transmission systems
4. Practically design and implement advanced digital transmission systems
5. Use effective written, numeric and technical communication methods, including
spreadsheets and technical reports, to convey ideas and principles
